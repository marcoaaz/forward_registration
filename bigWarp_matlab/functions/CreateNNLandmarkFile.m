function CreateNNLandmarkFile(mesh_points, mesh_points_trans, nn_dist_list, nn_idx_list, filter_width, out_file)
% Creates a landmark file using mesh_points that had the least change in
% nearest neighbor distance during the transformation. mesh_points should
% be a perfect point mesh, mesh_points_trans should be the transformed mesh
% points, nn_dist_list should contain the nearest neighbors distances for
% all relevent points in mesh_points_trans, nn_idx_list should contain the
% cooresponding indicies in mesh_points_trans for each value in
% nn_dist_list, filter_width should be the number of standard deviations
% away from the mean nn distastance a distance must be within to still be
% included, out_file should be the path to the to the landmark csv file you
% would like to write out to
