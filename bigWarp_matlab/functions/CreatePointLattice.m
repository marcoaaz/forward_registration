%TODO clean documentation
% Create an evenly spaced point mesh. dims should be a 3 by 2 matrix where
% the first column contains the starting dimension for x, y, and z (in that
% order) and the second column contains the coorespoinding end points. Will
% round up dimensions to the nearest number into whcih edge_length fits
% into evenly

points = zeros(size(x_vec, 2)*size(y_vec, 2)*size(z_vec, 2), 3);
